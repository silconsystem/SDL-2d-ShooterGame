/**************
	
	SLD-2D SHOOTER
	The name says it all,
	not a serious project.
	Just getting back in to coding again after a (too long) break

	I'm trying my hand at the SDL Library because of its rich
	documentation and large community for support.

	After wich I'll return to my GensokyoGame with LibGDX
	Wich will run on Android, Windows, Mac and Linux.

	Feel free to re-use all code and artwork
